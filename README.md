## Self-Introduction
- My research interest for now is mainly on _Video DeepFake Detection_. I am also interested in _Uncertainty Quantilification in Deep Learning_, _Multi-Task Learning_, _[Image Retinex](https://github.com/Holmes-GU/Image-Retinex)_ and _[object detection](https://github.com/Holmes-GU/Object-Detection)_.
