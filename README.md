## Self-Introduction
- My research interest for now is mainly on _DeepFake Video Detection_. I am also interested in _Uncertainty Quantilification in Deep Learning_, _Multi-Task Learning_, _[object detection](https://github.com/Holmes-GU/Object-Detection)_ and _[Retinex theory for low light image enhancement](https://github.com/Holmes-GU/Image-Retinex)_.
